## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Intuitive GUI Interface** - User-friendly parameter input with real-time validation
- **📊 Multi-Plot Visualization** - Four synchronized analytical plots in a single dashboard
- **⚡ Real-Time Analysis** - Instant visualization of parameter changes
- **🎓 Educational Focus** - Perfect for control theory learning and academic demonstrations
- **🔧 First-Order Systems** - Comprehensive analysis of transfer function G(s) = K/(τs + 1)

### Visualization Types:
- **Closed-loop step response** - Transient and steady-state analysis
- **Bode magnitude plot** - Frequency response in dB
- **Bode phase plot** - Phase characteristics in degrees
- **Nyquist diagram** - Stability analysis with critical point marking

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/control-systems-visualizer.git
cd control-systems-visualizer
Install required dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: On some Linux distributions, you may need to install tkinter separately:

bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
💡 Usage
Launching the Application
bash
python control_visualizer.py
Parameter Configuration
K (System Gain): Positive value controlling system amplification

τ (Time Constant): Positive value determining system response speed

Generating Visualizations
Enter desired values for K and τ

Click "Generate Plots" button

Analyze the four synchronized plots that appear

📈 Plot Descriptions
Step Response
Displays system output for unit step input

Shows transient response characteristics

Visualizes steady-state behavior and settling time

Bode Plots
Magnitude Plot: System gain in dB vs. frequency (rad/s)

Phase Plot: Phase shift in degrees vs. frequency (rad/s)

Essential for frequency domain analysis

Nyquist Plot
Complex plane representation of open-loop frequency response

Critical point (-1, 0) marked for stability assessment

Mirror image shown for negative frequencies
